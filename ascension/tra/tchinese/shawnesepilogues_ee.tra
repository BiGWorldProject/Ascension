@4004 = ~Many were the achievements of Anomen Delryn, the Shining Knight, and his much-renowned lady. They were known as heroes almost everywhere they went, and the cheers of their admirers drowned out any whispers pertaining to <CHARNAME>'s heritage. So prolific were their deeds that their wedding was constantly delayed, either due to some impending crisis or a lucrative mission that one or the other would insist on investigating. Finally, a day approached that both <CHARNAME> and her beloved were determined to keep. The heralded event drew heroes and dignitaries in droves from across Faer没n, and Elminster himself united the lovers in one of the grandest ceremonies the city of Baldur's Gate had ever hosted. <CHARNAME> and Anomen withdrew from public life shortly thereafter, though if tales be true, their adventures never truly ended. In time, their daughter Moira would forge her own legend.~
@4008 = ~And what of the eternally-playful Imoen? She had long stood in the shadow of <CHARNAME>, and had endured much, but her spirit never broke. Free of her father's legacy, she struck out on her own and briefly returned to Candlekeep. Her formidable knowledge of magic allowed a deeper appreciation of the great library, but it seemed smaller than she remembered, and she did not stay long. Imoen would use different names throughout her life, and was the subject of many a tall tale - perhaps the most memorable claiming that she'd picked the pocket of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, leading him on a merry magical chase across Faer没n that lasted four months. Another rumor claimed she'd founded a thieves' guild that ran the length and breadth of the entire Sword Coast, from Nashkel to Neverwinter. But when asked of such things, she would always answer with a smile of purest innocence: "Heya, it's just me, Imoen."~
@4015 = ~With the saga of the Bhaalspawn concluded, Minsc fulfilled a long-promised oath and returned to Rashemen, hoping to regale the Icedragon Berserker Lodge with tales of his deeds and thus earn a place within its hallowed halls. His words were not needed, though: every tavern in Faer没n had a bard singing of the valiant ranger, and he was welcomed home as a hero. Minsc went on to form his own adventuring company, the Justice Fist, striking fear in the hearts and faces of evil until, in his advancing age, he again set out across the Realms... and disappeared. And what of Boo? Well, what is Minsc without Boo? The two would never be separated, and some say they are together still, up amongst the stars where hamsters are giants and men become legends.~
@4018 = ~In the years following his resurrection by <CHARNAME>, Sarevok Anchev never settled anywhere for long. In Berdusk, he is said to have routed an army of invading orcs, displaying such power and rage that terrified locals weren't sure whom to fear more. In Westgate, he arrived as conqueror, brutally enforcing his will only to mysteriously vanish weeks later, leaving his startled followers to the mercies of an angry mob. He acted like a man that did not know himself, and it became abundantly clear that Sarevok was a tortured soul caught between life and death, unable to appreciate either. Eventually he disappeared entirely from Faer没n, and was thought to have taken his own life. In truth, he journeyed to Kara-Tur to bury his one true love, the warrior Tamoko. He never returned, though the stories endure.~
