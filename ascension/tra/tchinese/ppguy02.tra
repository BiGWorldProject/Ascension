@5 = ~You place your hand within the energies of the pool and draw the essence into yourself, diverting it away from Melissan.  Boundless power fills you, and while most of it dissipates you are left with much of Bhaal's essence.  For the moment, you have gained the ability to teleport freely throughout space and also fight for control of abyssal demons that are under Melissan's control. Part of this ability to teleport also means you are now completely immune to the spells Maze and Imprisonment.  The energies also restore the powers of all present.~
@6 = ~New power gained: "Control Demon"

This ability allows the Bhaalspawn to attempt to wrest control of a demon away from Melissan and make them an ally.  The Bhaalspawn engages the demon in mental combat for 1 round, at the end of which the demon has a chance of becoming an ally.  The demon is not under the Bhaalspawn's direct control, however.  This ability may be used once every 3 rounds.

New power gained: "Dimension Door"

The Bhaalspawn may now move freely through space and the planes.  This teleportation power is useable once per round.~
@7 = ~You place your hand within the energies of the pool and draw the essence into yourself, diverting it away from Melissan.  You are filled with boundless power for a moment... and while most of it leaves you and dissipates into the cosmos, a part of it remains with you.  You have gained the ability to focus the energies within you to protect yourself from such magics as Time Stop, Disintegrate and Flesh to Stone for a short period.  The energies also restore the powers of all present.~
@9 = ~New power gained: "Focus"

This ability allows the Bhaalspawn to focus his energy within him to resist spell effects from without.  For a 30-second duration, the Bhaalspawn becomes immune to the spells Flesh to Stone, Disintegration and Time Stop.  All minor spells of 1st through 3rd level will also not affect the Bhaalspawn.  This ability is useable once per minute.~
@10 = ~最後的能量池也已經被清空﹐巴爾王座的能量柱正在消散﹐你沒有多少時間可以準備了......~
@11 = ~梅麗珊已經在能量柱內開始活動了﹐一旦這個能量池被吸干﹐最後的決戰就要開始了。~
