@82715 = ~Aerie and <CHARNAME> would prove inseparable, continuing their adventuring for many years into the future. Aerie's zest for travel brought the pair over much of Faerûn and even further. Their young son was always in tow, making <CHARNAME> smile with his wide-eyed awe at the wonders of the world. Eventually the pair would settle, subsequently giving birth to a beautiful daughter that was the second joy of their lives. Only rarely would trouble cause <CHARNAME> and Aerie to bring their great power to bear against the evil of the world, though the tales of their battles would become legendary. Their later years would hold one last great trek, as Aerie still felt a sadness from her time of enslavement and the loss of her wings. Together she and <CHARNAME> sought the Avariel of Faenya-Dail, the winged elves she was stolen from so long ago. They discovered not only her people, but loving parents that had spent years searching for their lost child. Aerie had finally found her family. With no more mystery or confusion to cloud their lives, it was there, among the clouds, that Aerie and <CHARNAME> would finally be married. Their union, it is said, was blessed by the presence of Aerdrie Faenya and Baervan Wildwanderer both. As for the children of <CHARNAME> and Aerie, tutored by two of the Realm's most powerful beings, their own destiny would be a tale to rival their father's...~
@82717 = ~Anomen and <CHARNAME> continued adventuring until they were known as heroes almost everywhere they went. Many were the grand tales of the Shining Knight and his utter devotion to his great lady. <CHARNAME>'s past as the terrible Bhaalspawn was forgotten forever as new deeds replaced old and a legacy was created that far outstripped anything granted by godly blood. So prolific were their careers that the proposed date of their wedding kept getting moved back, either due to impending crisis or some lucrative adventure that one or the other would insist on investigating. Finally a date approached that both <CHARNAME> and her beloved were determined to keep, and the much heralded event drew heroes and dignitaries from across Faerûn. The couple had touched the lives of many, and those people arrived in droves to watch Elminster himself unite the two in one of the grandest ceremonies the city of Baldur's Gate had ever seen. Anomen and <CHARNAME> retired from public life shortly after the celebrated birth of their daughter, although if tales be true, their adventures never truly ended. Anomen would rise high in the hierarchy of his church, and <CHARNAME> would continue to be the center of strange events throughout their lives. So, too, would their daughter, tutored by two of the greatest heroes in the Realms, forge a legend to rival that of her mother's. That, however, is another story completely...~
@82727 = ~After parting ways with <CHARNAME>, Valygar continued his adventures for several years, traveling in the wilds of northern Faerûn and becoming a common sight in the area of Waterdeep. Later he was content to finally return to Athkatla and retire to the quiet, contemplative life at his family's estate that he had always desired. Pressure from admirers within the local nobility saw him taking up the mantle of Chief Inspector, a responsibility he never desired but took on willingly to combat the growing corruption within the city. For many years, Valygar's was the name spat by every criminal or slaver who dared to place a foot within the city. Valygar was dauntless, turning the city garrison into a force even the most self-confident thief had to respect. Valygar and the Shadow Thieves sparred many times, eventually reaching a point of mutual respect... though most considered the ranger the victor even then. Surprising even himself, Valygar eventually restored the good name of the Corthalas in Athkatla and even married. His only son, the pride of his life, took the lessons of his father to heart. Valygar would watch him go on to become the head of the Cowled Wizards and its greatest agent of reform, and for once in his life Valygar would know pride. Remembering the man that he had once been, fleeing his history into the deepest woods of Amn, the ranger would be thankful that <CHARNAME> had entered his life and forever wish his old friend well.~
