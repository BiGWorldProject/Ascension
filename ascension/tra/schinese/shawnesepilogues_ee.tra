@4004 = ~阿诺门和<CHARNAME>继续他们的冒险,直到他们所去的地方到处都有认识他们的人，很多传说都是关于这个骑士和他所为之奉献的女士。当他们的新事迹事迹代替了从前的传说时，<CHARNAME>作为巴尔之子的黑暗往事被永远的遗忘了。由于这样那样的事，使他们的婚期一再拖延，其中要么就是为了应付一场来临的危险，要么就是因为两人中的一人坚持要完成一次有意义的冒险。最后，<CHARNAME>与阿诺门终于定下了婚期，这个消息引来了费仑大陆的许多政界要人还有四方的英雄参加，这对夫妇遇到了许多的客人，而他们也都有幸见到了艾尔明斯特为<CHARNAME>和阿诺门所亲自主持的这个博德之门有史以来最大的婚礼。阿诺门和<CHARNAME>在为他们的女儿出生庆祝后，从公众的瞩目中退隐了。阿诺门在海姆教区里成了高阶守望者，而<CHARNAME>继续成为各种奇怪事件的中心人物，当然，作为<CHARNAME>与阿诺门的孩子，被这个遗忘国度里最有强大的两个人抚养，他们今后的命运一定是可与其母亲相匹敌的传说，不过这是另一个传奇了...~
@4008 = ~And what of the eternally-playful Imoen? She had long stood in the shadow of <CHARNAME>, and had endured much, but her spirit never broke. Free of her father's legacy, she struck out on her own and briefly returned to Candlekeep. Her formidable knowledge of magic allowed a deeper appreciation of the great library, but it seemed smaller than she remembered, and she did not stay long. Imoen would use different names throughout her life, and was the subject of many a tall tale - perhaps the most memorable claiming that she'd picked the pocket of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, leading him on a merry magical chase across Faerûn that lasted four months. Another rumor claimed she'd founded a thieves' guild that ran the length and breadth of the entire Sword Coast, from Nashkel to Neverwinter. But when asked of such things, she would always answer with a smile of purest innocence: "Heya, it's just me, Imoen."~
@4015 = ~With the saga of the Bhaalspawn concluded, Minsc fulfilled a long-promised oath and returned to Rashemen, hoping to regale the Icedragon Berserker Lodge with tales of his deeds and thus earn a place within its hallowed halls. His words were not needed, though: every tavern in Faerûn had a bard singing of the valiant ranger, and he was welcomed home as a hero. Minsc went on to form his own adventuring company, the Justice Fist, striking fear in the hearts and faces of evil until, in his advancing age, he again set out across the Realms... and disappeared. And what of Boo? Well, what is Minsc without Boo? The two would never be separated, and some say they are together still, up amongst the stars where hamsters are giants and men become legends.~
@4018 = ~在被<CHARNAME>复活后的几年，沙洛弗克从不在一个地方逗留很长时间。据说他后来击退了一支侵略波达斯克城市的兽人大军，当地人认为他所展示出来的可怕力量和狂暴愤怒无人能敌。以后沙洛弗克又以一个征服者的姿态来到了西门城，并残忍地为所欲为，不料几个月后，他却神秘地失踪了。他之前的所做所为就好象完全不知道自己是谁，所有的故事都一致认为沙洛弗克是一个受到折磨的灵魂，辗转于生存与死亡，可是从来没有真正到达任何一面。那些少数真正了解沙洛弗克的人说这位饱受折磨的战士有时会诅咒<CHARNAME>，有时则会感谢<CHARNAME>给了他第二次机会。但最后他还是失踪了，有人说是去攻打地狱，还有人甚至说他自杀了，事实上，沙洛弗克去了卡拉图，安葬他所真正爱过的人，一位女性战士--坦摩科。之后他再也没有回来，但关于他的故事却被流传了下来......~
