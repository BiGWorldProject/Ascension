DW thoughts:

- ideally, regeneration should only kick in on Hard+ (this requires a little work, of course)
- Yaga-Shura only gets his powers on Easy+; strip them away on Easiest
- Abazigal, Sarevok, Gromnir only uses HLAs on Easy+
- the Five don't use Freedom spells on Easiest
- Sendai doesn't use Creeping Doom, Power Word Kill, initial sequencer/trigger
